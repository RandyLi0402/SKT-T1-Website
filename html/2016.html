        <h1>Worlds 2016</h1>
        <p>At the 2016 Season World Championship, SK Telecom T1 were placed into Group B, along with LMS's Flash Wolves,
          NA's Cloud 9, and China's I May. The team proceeded to win five of the six games during the Group Stage, as they
          displayed a vast arsenal of team compositions and fielded both Bengi and Blank in the jungle position. They were
          drafted into the Quarterfinals against the Chinese Royal Never Give Up, the second place team of Group D. After
          beating RNG 3-1, they proceeded to the semifinals where they met the ROX Tigers. After a long and grueling five
          games, where ROX won two of them with a surprise Miss Fortune support, SKT won 3-2 in what host Dash called the
          greatest best of five at Worlds ever. They moved on to face Samsung Galaxy in the Grand Finals: after a long,
          hard-fought 3-2 series SKT became the first League of Legends team to win three World Championships and first
          repeat winners of the title of World Champions.</p>
